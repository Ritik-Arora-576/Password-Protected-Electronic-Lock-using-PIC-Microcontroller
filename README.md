# Password-Protected-Electronic-Lock-using-PIC-Microcontroller

The proposed system implements a password protected electronic lock that provides a great benefit over a traditional lock, as well as great security. The system comprises a keypad and 16x2 LCD along with a PIC18F452 microcontroller. The present state is notified by the LCD to the user. Users can perform operations such as opening and closing the lock, changing the current password through keypad instruction. The aim of this project is to make a lock which will ensure security as well as cost efficient implementation.  Password protected electronic lock comprises keypad as input, LCD display as output device and microcontroller as controlling unit. To model the lock for the simulation a DC motor has been connected through Relays. In practical use, Solenoids and relays are used in actual electronic locks to lock and unlock.

The lock system is protected by a password which is set by the user. The lock is opened only when the correct password is inserted. On the other hand, the Password changing option is somehow more secure, that only authorized people can do it. While changing the password, a fixed security code (known to authorized person) along with the old password is needed. Thus the enhanced security of the system is ensured.
